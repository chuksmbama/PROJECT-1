<p><h2>Special Parameters</h2></p>

<p><h4>Kinematics is a part of mechanics (a branch in physics)which deals with the motions of particles without any reference to the forces responsible. <br> 
In kinematics,all forces responsible/agents of forces are completely ingnored. Special parameters in kinematics include</h4></p>

<h4>
1.Position <br>
2.Distance  <br>
3.Speed  <br>
4.Velocity  <br>
5.Acceleration
